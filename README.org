* Introduction
  This is a thin CFFI wrapper around the [[https://github.com/seanchas116/libqmlbind][libqmlbind]] binding for QT5's QML
  engine. Functions are wrapped directly; the names are the same as
  the C functions, but with underscores replaced with hyphens. For
  example, =qmlbind_value_unwrap= is =QMLBIND-VALUE-UNWRAP=.

** Regenerating the Bindings
   To re-generate the bindings, run =./scripts/generate.sh= and commit
   the alterations to =ffi.lisp=. The environment variable
   =QMLBIND_HEADERS= can be used to set the location of the headers;
   this must be set to the directory containing the =qmlbind/= header
   directory (i.e. =/usr/include/=, not =/usr/include/qmlbind/=). This
   defaults to =/usr/include/= for convenience.

   At the time of writing, SWIG has dropped support for the CFFI
   target, so you will need a version of SWIG prior to 4.0. You may
   also need to edit the generation script, e.g. if a 3.x SWIG is
   packaged as =swig-3= as it is on Arch Linux.
